The size of Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws, Skowkale and Tzeachten in 1864 was 2,500 acres or 1,012 hectares. In 1867, under Joseph Trutch\u2019s direction, all central Fraser Valley St\u00f3:l\u014d reserves were resurveyed and reduced. Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws, Skowkale and Tzeachten were reduced to 200 acres or 81 hectares; today there are 914 acres or 370 hectares.\n\nEntire extended families lived in a longhouse, if there were additions to the family and the longhouse became too small, they added on to the longhouse. That\u2019s how the longhouses got so long. Chief Louie described a longhouse along Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws that was a thousand feet long. It housed a huge family and they stayed here because the fish were plentiful. Bert Louie said, the longhouse that stood there burnt down. The present hereditary Chief Frank Malloway (Siy\u00e9mches) thinks that it couldn\u2019t have happened that long ago because when he built his \u201cRichard Malloway Memorial Longhouse\u201d, on Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws reserve, he found 2 inches of black soil, almost like ashes. Longhouse floors were built 4 feet down. That\u2019s where the name Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws came from \u201cYeqw: means fire. Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws means \u201cburned out many times, Yeqwyeqw\u00ed:ws is \u201ca site that has been a place of many fires\u201d, sometimes resulting from raids.  We never had \u201cChiefs\u201d a long time ago, families appointed their family leader through the use of important ancestral names. The Department of Indian Affairs first appointed the \u201cChiefs\u201d through their Indian Agents and later created the present Chief election system.\n\nSome high status Smel\u00e1:lh \u201cWorthy People\u201d+O89 became especially respected and developed a reputation for leadership.

They hunted animals such as deer, moose, elk, marmot, black bear and grouse and fished the rivers and creeks for salmon and trout.

Salmon were prized above all other fish and were the economic, cultural and spiritual focus of First Nations in the Fraser River Basin.

These Nlaka\u2019pamux ancestors enjoyed a rich, complex cultural and spiritual life with teachings that structured social life and governance.  When European settlers arrived in Nlaka\u2019pamux territory in the first half of the 19th century, our ancestors willingly entered into economic relationships with these new neighbours, while incorporating the new technologies and occupations they brought with them into our lives.  By the mid-19th century, the newcomer population had grown exponentially, which in turn resulted in many changes to daily life in Nlaka\u2019pamux communities. Although our ancestors continued to engage in traditional activities on the land, accessing that land became more difficult as settlers put up fences and privatized large areas of our traditional territory.\nIn addition to continuing with their traditional activities, our ancestors adapted to this new way of life and the new rules and regulations about accessing lands and resources that were imposed by colonial governments.

Although the entire island was designated an Indian Reserve (Halalt Island No. 1), the village was abandoned in the 1920s and the residents moved to the Westholme reserve on the lower Chemainus River (Halalt No. 2).", "spread": "Vancouver Island - Southeastern", "web": "https://halalt.org/", "map": "Halalt First Nation", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/halalt_first_nation_fcrsa.pdf", "pronounce": "Ha-lalt", "election": [9, 16, 2023], "spreadNumber": null}]}, "Heiltsuk First Nation": {"loc": [52.1625291742136, -128.144738642665], "info": [{"community": "Heiltsuk First Nation", "leadership": "Chief Councillor Marilyn Slett, 4 yr term - next election August 9, 2022", "contactPerson": "Chief Councillor Marilyn Slett", "address": "P.O.

They used the intricate network of waterways to travel from well-established winter villages to numerous seasonal camps situated on salmon streams, along ancient trading routes, and on far-flung outer islands. When Europeans arrived in the eighteenth century there were several Heiltsuk villages on the various islands near the present-day location of Bella Bella. In 1833 the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company established Fort McLoughlin, a heavily fortified fur trading post, on what is now McLoughlin Bay on Campbell Island. The Heiltsuk already had a well-established trading network on the coast, but the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company sought to supplant indigenous people as middlemen in the the fur trade wherever possible. Still, the officers at Fort McLoughlin found the Heiltsuk would not allow themselves to be pushed aside.\n\nDespite initial hostilities, within a few years a new Heiltsuk village was established in close proximity to Fort McLoughlin. The Heiltsuk became well known as skilled and savvy traders and developed a lucrative, if uneasy, business relationship with the fort. The Heiltsuk knew the village as \u2019Q\u00e9lc, but Europeans recorded various other names for the village, perhaps derived from the local geographical nameP\u00e9lb\u00e1la, that eventually gave rise to the modern English name Bella Bella. Members of Heiltsuk-speaking tribes from across the region who gradually relocated to the village over the next sixty years became known as the Bella Bella Indians. When Fort McLoughlin closed in 1843 the site was abandoned by Europeans. The village of \u2019Q\u00e9lc remained and the Heiltsuk continued to trade with the steamship-based trading system that replaced the fort.\n\nIn the winter of 1862-3 a devastating smallpox epidemic took a massive toll on the Heiltsuk population across our territory. Many villages were wiped out entirely, and most others didn\u2019t have enough people left to sustain them. Survivors from the various Heiltsuk tribes gradually amalgamated at Bella Bella, which is centrally located in Heiltsuk territory.\n\nIn 1866 European traders reoccupied the fort site at McLoughlin Bay and established a small store and a post office. Then, in 1880, Bella Bella (\u2019Q\u00e9lc) became the focus of Methodist mission work on the central coast. The villagers were encouraged to abandon their traditional bighouses and seasonal camps in favour of European-style houses. However, because most of the suitable building area on McLoughlin Bay was \u201cclaimed\u201d by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, there was a scarcity of land on which to build such houses. By the turn of the century most of the greatly diminished Heiltsuk population resided in Bella Bella (\u2019Q\u00e9lc), which had become crowded.\n\nIn 1897 the Heiltsuk, making the decision to move, surveyed a new town site three kilometres north of McLoughlin Bay. This place was known to the Heiltsuk as W\u00e1gl\u00edsla (meaning \u201criver on the beach\u201d). Building progressed quickly and by 1900 the people of \u2019Q\u00e9lc had relocated to the new village, which boasted large European-style houses and Heiltsuk-run businesses. This new community was called New Bella Bella.\n\nFor a time the prosperous new Heiltsuk village was a busy centre of trading and shipping activities on the coast. Within a decade the village was the second largest on the coast, with a hospital, school, sawmill, fire hall, wharf, warehouse, and planked roads with street lights. Residents contributed to, and shared in, the success of nearby ventures like Ocean Falls and Namu.\n\nIn 1914 a cannery was built on Denny Island. The store and post office at McLoughlin Bay were moved to the small town that grew around the cannery. Along with the post office went the name \u201cBella Bella\u201d, which was inherited by the new Denny Island settlement, giving rise to a confusion of names that persists today.\n\nAs the century progressed, diminishing resources and the decreasing dependence of industry on remote communities caused New Bella Bella\u2019s existence to become more isolated and precarious. Ocean Falls and Namu eventually became ghost towns and the cannery on Denny Island fell into ruin. The community on Denny Island relocated to nearby Kliktsoatli Harbour, where an airstrip was built in WWII, becoming Shearwater.\n\nBut New Bella Bella (Waglisla) was revitalized by the building of an airport and BC Ferries terminal and continued to grow and prosper. Today this vital, contemporary community is simply called Bella Bella.\n\nToday the \u2019Q\u00e9lc village site, all but disappeared, is known as Old Bella Bella or Old Town. McLoughlin Bay, connected now by road to Bella Bella, is the site of the BC Ferries terminal, a Heiltsuk fish processing plant, and a salmon hatchery.

Long before the emergence of any other human community in the lower Fraser region, the Creator placed five communities, each with its own chief, at different locations on the land. Those locations are now known as Pitt lake, Sheridan Hill, Port Hammond, Point Roberts and Point Grey. The Katzie people are the direct descendants of these first people; the people that came to be known as the Katzie people descend primarily from Oe'lecten and his people, created at the south shore of Pitt Lake, and Swaneset and his people, created at Sheridan Hill.\n\nDuring these first days after the arrival of human beings, there were few trees, and although there were clams and mussels in the rivers and along the seashore, there was no wind and there were no birds, land animals, sturgeon, salmon, oolichan or sea lions. But the Creator gave these first five leaders gifts and powers to bequeath to those that followed after them. When he placed Swaneset on the earth, the Creator provided the sun and the moon. For Oe'lecten, the Creator provided the seasons and the rainbow.\n\nOe'lecten was then granted a wife, and their children became the sturgeon and a white bird that can only be seen by Oe'lecten's descendants. Oe'lecten's people first settled in villages at Fox Creek, Widgeon Creek at the southwest corner of Pitt Lake, a village occupied until recently, presently known as Katzie I.R. 4.\n\nSwaneset, honouring the Creator's instructions to finish making the territory surrounding the place he had been set down on earth, reshaped the land in order to make it abundant in berry and root crops. Standing on the peak of Sheridan Hill, which was once the highest mountain in the territory, Swaneset called on the help of the Creator, and made Sturgeon Slough and its tributaries. He then made the Alouette River and other sloughs, including Katzie Slough. Swaneset then named all these waterways, and named the river now known as the Fraser. After a time, Swaneset travelled to the sky, and returned to earth with a wife, setting down again on the peak of Sheridan Hill. From the pieces of Sheridan Hill, Swaneset created many of the distinctive hills that mark the countryside between the Fraser River and Pitt Lake. When Swaneset had finished reshaping the land to make it more abundant for his people, he then instructed all his people to gather at Katzie to make homes for themselves here, in the vicinity of the present Pitt Meadows reserve. There, on the banks of the Fraser River, his sky-born wife opened her dowry box, and ushered oolichan and seagulls into this world, and she taught the people how to catch the fish and prepare them. for additional info.    eire.ca/history/heritage/hist1.html", "spread": "Spread 6 (KP 1075.1 to 1144.480)", "web": "No official community site", "map": "Katzie First Nation", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/katzie_fcrsa_renewal_2-years_term_executed_sep_15_2020.pdf", "pronounce": "KUT-zee", "election": [], "spreadNumber": 6.0}]}, "Kelly Lake Cree Nation  (As'in'I'Wa'Chi Ni'yaw Nation)": {"loc": [55.2551865807595, -120.036378390376], "info": [{"community": "Kelly Lake Cree Nation  (As'in'I'Wa'Chi Ni'yaw Nation)", "leadership": "Chief Kwarakwante Cliff Calliou", "contactPerson": "Linette Calliou, Manager Environment, Health & Safety", "address": "PO Box 66, Toms Lake, BC  V0C 2L0", "contactInfo": "Office: (780) 356-3125  lhodges@kellylakecreenation.com chief@klcn.ca", "protocol": "Linette Calliou, Manager Environment, Health & Safety", "about": null, "spread": null, "web": "https://www.kellylakecreenation.com/", "map": null, "srcTxt": null, "srcLnk": null, "pronounce": null, "election": [], "spreadNumber": null}]}, "Kelly Lake First Nation": {"loc": [55.5555170735692, -120.07615854366], "info": [{"community": "Kelly Lake First Nation", "leadership": "Chief Norman Calliou", "contactPerson": "Chief Norman Calliou", "address": "PO Box 116, Toms Lake, BC  V0C 2L0", "contactInfo": "klfnconsultation@gmail.com", "protocol": "Chief Norman Calliou", "about": null, "spread": null, "web": "https://kellylakefirstnation.com/", "map": null, "srcTxt": null, "srcLnk": null, "pronounce": null, "election": [], "spreadNumber": null}]}, "Kelly Lake Metis Settlement Society": {"loc": [55.2551865807595, -120.036378390376], "info": [{"community": "Kelly Lake Metis Settlement Society", "leadership": "Not Available", "contactPerson": "Lyle Letendre", "address": "Not Available", "contactInfo": "Office: (780) 814-5513 or (780) 356-3338  mamway@telus.net", "protocol": "Lyle Letendre", "about": null, "spread": null, "web": "No official community site", "map": null, "srcTxt": null, "srcLnk": null, "pronounce": null, "election": [], "spreadNumber": null}]}, "Kwantlen First Nation": {"loc": [49.171628990299, -122.565426566965], "info": [{"community": "Kwantlen First Nation (tireless Runner)", "leadership": "Chief Marilyn Gabriel (November 30, 1993)", "contactPerson": "Economic Development contact: Brenda Fernie, VP, Seyem Qwantlen Business Group (604) 888-5556 info@seyemqwantlen.ca", "address": "23690 Gabriel Lane, Langley, BC, V1M 2R4", "contactInfo": "Office: (604) 888-2488  Brenda's (604) 888-5556  info@seyemqwantlen.ca ashley@kwantlenlands.ca", "protocol": "Ashley Doyle - Land and Resource Manager", "about": "Since time immemorial, we live by the seven traditional laws that guided our ancestors: health, happiness, generations, generosity, humbleness, forgiveness and understanding.

The Similkameen People were originally a nomadic people that moved from location to location, mainly due to the ever changing availability of foods and climates. There were certain criteria that had to be met, for an encampment or village site to be located. The potential areas had to have Look-Out Points, Nearby Food and Water Sources, Wood Availability, and Hunting Grounds .\nThe original Native Encampment in the Keremeos area was located where Bear\u2019s Fruit Stand now presides.\n\nThe population of this encampment has been estimated to be between 800 \u2013 1000 people.  This encampment had a good water supply, had good look-out points, and was easily defended.  There was another encampment located nearby, at what is now the Rocking Chair Ranch.  This encampment had an estimated 500 people living there.  They had a fresh-water spring, that provided an excellent source of water.  Also at this location, was a plentiful supply of reeds and tulies.\n\nBefore and upon Contact with Non-Natives, the Dwellings that the Similkameen people stayed in consisted of Pit Houses, Tulie Shelters, Ntamlken Lodges, and Winter Kickwillies.  Pit Houses were made of wood and hemp.  Tulie Shelters were made of reeds, wood and hemp.  Ntamlken Lodges were made with reeds, wood and hemp rope.  Summer Lodges were made of poles and fir boughs.  Winter Kickwillies were made of poles, grass, bark, tulies, and skins of animals.\n\nOriginally, the Similkameen people had a social structure which was governed by a line of Hereditary Chiefs within the greater community.  Each village was led by a Chief that cared for the particular needs of that village.  Advisors known as Wise/Good Men and Women assisted the Chiefs with the difficult decisions that had to be made.\n\nPrior to Contact with Non-Natives, the Similkameen people would gather seasonally to trade goods with Neighbouring Tribes.  Depending on which season it was, the locations would vary.  At these different sites, thenumber of people that gathered to trade could number anywhere from 2000 \u2013 5000 people.  At these trading sites, sometimes the different tribes would compete in games as a form of social gathering and also to demonstrate their strength as a people.\n\nThe coming of Non-Natives to the Similkameen can be mainly attributed to the expansion of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Trading Company, not to mention Missionaries that were sent to live amongst the native population.  Sometime after this, more Non-Natives settled in the Similkameen area during the Gold Rush.", "spread": "Thompson Country Spread 4 (KP 610 to 764)", "web": "https://www.lsib.net/", "map": "LowerSimilkameen598", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/lsib_signed_fcrsa_minister_signed_july_12_2019.pdf", "pronounce": "Si-MIL-kuh-meen", "election": [12, 6, 2021], "spreadNumber": 4.0}]}, "Lyackson First Nation": {"loc": [49.1149186382442, -119.724028514332], "info": [{"community": "Lyackson First Nation", "leadership": "Chief Pahalicktun (Richard Thomas) appointed by the late Hereditary Chief Gordon Thomas 1993", "contactPerson": "Shannon Gammie, Director of Operations", "address": "7973A Chemainus Road\nChemainus, BC, V0R 1K5", "contactInfo": "Phone: (250) 246-5019\ndirectorofoperations@lyackson.bc.ca   consultations@Lyackson.bc.ca", "protocol": "Karyn Scott, Consultation Coordinator", "about": "The Lyackson Homeland is Valdes Island.

The Lakes Secwepemc inhabits the eastern most part the Secwepemc Territory in and around the South Thompson River and the large Shuswap, Adams and Mara Lakes.  Traditionally this complex of waterways played a large role in the Lakes Secwepemc travel patterns.\n\nLake Division Secwepemc Winter villages were almost exclusively on the River Terraces on dry, well-drained sites near major streams and along lakes within the Lakes Division territories with good south exposure and shelter from the valley winds. Villages were often near an important fishery, so there were many small villages of a few families scattered up and down the main rivers and along major lakes.  Pit houses were the preferred c7\u2019Istkten (winter homes), but there were other styles of insulated houses as well.\n\nThe Lakes Secwepemc delayed their move into the village as long as good weather held, but usually they were settled in by November. Early in winter, the villages were used as a basecamp for hunting and fishing expeditions while the houses were readied for the swucwt (snow) season.  Ts\u2019i7 (deer), Ten\u2019Iye (moose) and SweIaps (sheep) moved down from the mountains in their autumn prime and closer to the villages. These important food animals were in their rut in November, and easy to bait and call. The rivers were the source of sqlelten (salmon), a staple in Secwepemc diet, economy and culture. Whenever salmon were in our rivers, our people harvested sqlelten using various methods. Even in early spring and early winter a few people would be camped near the salmon rivers, eating fresh sqlelten.  By mid-summer, the main sqlelten runs were underway and most people were camped at the riverside fishing stations.  A frenzied month of fishing, processing, camp maintenance, and transportation to the winter village gradually ended as the fishery tapered off. The fishing basecamps were the centre of feasting, marriage, ceremony, and dancing. Important fishing camps were also the point of trade between neighboring villages and nations. Major bartering ceremonies in the region attracted over 1,000 participants.\n\nLate in the sqlelten season, men made snowshoes, nets, rope and other winter gear or searched for the fine-grained rock, especially black basalt to make adzes and other tools. Women completed processing and storing the catch.  The River Valley was hunted for Ts\u2019i7 and other ungulates seeking winter protection in the riverside forests, but only on mild days because the animals were lean. In deep S7istk (winter) our people stayed in the village and lived on food stored during spring, summer and fall foraging trips.  On warmer days, a few individuals and small parties might try pixem (hunting) for Ts\u2019i7 in nearby grasslands or ice fishing or hare and grouse snaring near a forest margin.\n\nThe Lakes Secwepemc left their c7\u2019Istkten\u2019s as soon as weather allowed, usually in February when melting snows and longer days made hunting easier, and even a few early plants were sprouting. The River Terraces near the villages were also habitat for many plants the Secwepemc used for food.  Spring was also the time to collect materials for making the basic tools of Secwepemc technology -bows, arrows, containers, tool handles, rope, and cordage, made from sap-filled willow, mock orange, juniper birch, maple, cottonwood, Saskatoon, and bitter cherry.", "spread": "Thompson Country Spread 4 (KP 610 to 764)", "web": "https://neskonlith.net/", "map": "Neskonlith Indian Band", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/forestry-agreements/neskonlith_ftoa_19dec12.pdf", "pronounce": "Nes-con-lith", "election": [1, 23, 2023], "spreadNumber": 4.0}]}, "Nooaitch Indian Band": {"loc": [50.1540952465102, -121.037387988603], "info": [{"community": "Nooaitch Indian Band", "leadership": "Chief Marcel Shackkelly", "contactPerson": "Larry Jordan, Band Administator", "address": "2954 Shackelly Rd.,  Merritt, BC  V1K 1N9", "contactInfo": "Office: (250) 378-6141 reception@nooaitch.com   ljordan@nooaitch.com   david@nooaitchband.ca", "protocol": "David Lawrence Bosnich, Lands Manager", "about": "The Nooaitch Indian Band is one of the member\u2019s bands of the Nicola Valley Tribal Nation.

Pacheedaht people are related by kinship, language and culture to several other First Nations on Vancouver Island and to the Makah. According to traditional history, long ago Pacheedaht and Ditidaht ancestors lived together as one tribe at an origin village located on the river whose native name is Diitiida. If you look for the name Diitiida on a map today, you won't find it, since most of the Pacheedaht names for places have been replaced by English place names. The river the Pacheedaht call Diitiida is marked as \"Jordan River\" on modern maps.\n\n The Ditidaht First Nation get their name from the village shared at Jordan River. Ditidaht means \"People of Diitiida,\" or people of Jordan River. During the great flood, some of the people living at Diitiida managed to survive by fleeing in a canoe that they anchored to the top of a high mountain in order to escape the rising waters. Afterwards some of the survivors settled at Whyac village at the outlet of Nitinat Lake into the Pacific Ocean, and became the ancestors of the people who today form the Ditidaht First Nation.\n\nOthers amongst the flood survivors returned to the village at Diitiida (Jordan River) and settled once again in their home territory. Eventually this branch of the people from Diitiida became centred on a village at the head of Port San Juan at the mouth of the San Juan River, called p'a:chi:da. This is also the native name for the San Juan River. Before the diseases came to our territory, brought by white explorers, traders and settlers, some estimates say that the Pacheedaht numbered 1,500 people or more. Pacheedaht ancestors followed a seasonal round that included moving residence to several places throughout an average year in order to take advantage of seasonally abundant resources. Pacheedaht villages and camps were spread throughout the territory, especially along the coastline and on the banks and mouths of larger rivers.

A reserve for the \u201cLangley Indians\u201d (Kwantlen First Nation) nd Musqueam (Musqueam I.R. #1) was established directly on top of the fishing village of qiq\u00e9yt. In 1879, the federal government allocated three reserves as general reserves for \u201cAll Coastal Indians.\u201d These reserves were established inclusive of 104 acres (0.42 km2) of the South Westminster Reserve, 22 acres (89,000 m2) on the North Arm of the Fraser River and 27 acres (110,000 m2) on Poplar Island.[2] These carry the Musqueam names of yel\u0259\u026ck\u02b7\u0259, sk\u02b7tex\u02b7q\u0259n, and w\u0259\u0301q\u0313\u02b7a\u03c7\u0259n s\u03c7\u02b7ay\u0259m\u0259\u026c.\n\nOn September 4, 1913 George Roberts \u201cof the New Westminster Band of Indians\u201d met with commissioners of the British Columbia, Royal Commission on Indian Affairs. In his interview Roberts acknowledged Musqueam as chief of the \u201cNew Westminster\u201d Indians and many Musqueam continued to use the site seasonally through the 1930s and 40s for fishing.[3] Musqueam continued to live at qiq\u00e9yt into the 1930s. In 1959 this reserve was sold to pay for a water systems on Musqueam's I.R. #2. qiq\u00e9yt continues to be important to Musqueam and they continue to fish in the waters around this important village site.  In Musqueam issued their Declaration which states Musqueam\u2019s rights and title to their unceded traditional territory and countersigned by the community at the time. qiq\u00e9yt is site #32.\n\nKwantlen First Nation recognizes qiqeyt as a very significant part of their unceded traditional territory. Many Kwantlen families trace their direct lineage from qiqeyt Village in South Westminster (now Lehigh Hanson Concrete Batch Plant).\n\nThe Aboriginal Gathering Place at the New Westminster campus of Douglas College was built in partnership with the Qayqayt First Nation. This Gathering Place contains a large mural depicting and celebrating the Band and its people.  Wikipedia        In the 19th century, a village alongside of what is now Front Street in New Westminster was called Qayqayt (pronounced Ka-kite). In 1859, New Westminster City Council sought to remove the First Peoples from the city core, creating three reserves in the surrounding area, including 27 acres of Poplar Island and 105 acres across the Fraser River at Bridgeview.   A smallpox epidemic killed many First Peoples in 1904; in 1916, the McKenna McBride Commission closed the New Westminster Indian Reserve and told the residents to move. Many reserves in British Columbia were being closed at this time, most without compensation or alternative lands to help them move. Qayqayt from New Westminster were married into or adopted into other Nations, relocating to Musqueam, Squamish, and Washington State. The story of the Qayqayt was almost forgotten.  Chief Larrabee\u2019s mother, aunt and uncle were the last few living members of the Qayqayt First Nation, which once numbered 400 people before their lands were sold and their remaining reserve was deemed inactive in 1951. Chief Larrabee\u2019s journey of self-discovery led her to apply for Indian Status in 1994, resurrect the Qayqayt Band, become chief, and work to keep the legacy of her ancestors alive through education.

Shxw\u2019\u014dwh\u00e1m\u00e9l also has 2 other reserves: Wahleach IR #2 located along the Lougheed Highway, and Xelh\u00e1lh (kuth-lath) IR#3 located north of Yale BC along Highway #1.    Xelh\u00e1lh holds special significance for us. Xelh\u00e1lh was strategically placed overlooking the Fraser River, and was protected by a fortress and the river itself. The river in this area has several whirlpools and rapids which, back then, made it challenging to navigate to shore for any people unfamiliar with the area. In addition to the remnants of the fortress, Xelh\u00e1lh was the home for a large number of people up until the 1850s. When the population was decimated by the smallpox epidemic our remaining ancestors were moved by the colonial government. The federal government moved our ancenstor to Shxw\u2019\u014dwh\u00e1m\u00e9l trying to encourage them to pursue agricultural as way of building a substancial economy. This idea shifted our people away from relying on fishing, hunting, and gathering and trading between the communities.  St\u00f3l\u014d means 'People of the River' in our Traditional Halq'em\u00e9ylem language. The Fraser River was central to the lives of our ancestors and was formerly used as a major transportation conduit for facilitating trade with other villages. The Fraser River was and still remains a critical resource to our peoples' way of life as a food source . The lands and waters of our territory have provided many traditional resources of great value to the people of Shxw\u2019\u014dwh\u00e1m\u00e9l.

Archaeological surveys have found winter sites and food cache pits throughout the region, including finds in Finn Creek, Vavenby, Birch Island, Clearwater, Little Fort, Chu Chua, Barriere, Louis Creek, T\u00eate Jeune, and Jasper.  Traditionally, the Simpcw people were known for their hunting abilities; much of the Simpcw culture centres on the gathering of local plants and animals for survival. In the summer months, hunting camps were established above the North Thompson and upper Fraser Rivers, where Simpcw people caught fish, primarily salmon, with nets, spears and weirs. They also hunted wildlife that lived in the forests and fields, and smoked or dried the meat for storage, so they would have food for the winter months. Plant collection was common; food, medicines and technology were common uses for the vegetation they collected.   Simpcw people often interacted with other First Nations bands that lived nearby, as well. They actively traded with other Secwepemc bands, as well as other Nations throughout the area. Sometimes, they fought with other Nations from BC and Alberta, usually over natural resources and land.   Currently, Simpcw First Nation has nearly 700 members, many of whom live in Chu Chua, the location of the main village of Simpcw First Nation. Many Simpcw members still practice and maintain traditional knowledge and customs, which are taught at Neqweyqwelsten School, along with the regular BC elementary school curriculum.

The other Dakelh communities are Lhoosk\u2019us Dene, Nazko, and Lhtalo Dene (formerly Red Bluff). In earlier times before British Columbia became colonized by Euro-Canadians, Ulkatcho Village was an important potlatching and trading centre at the junction of many trading trails heading north to Chezlatta, east to the Fraser River, west to the Central Coast, and north to the Chilcotin Plateau. The village consisted of a potlatch house and several temporary brush shelters on the shore of Gatcho Lake about 80 kilometres north of Anahim Lake. There were similar potlatch houses in other parts of Ulkatcho territory. Mac Squinas said his grandfather Captain Harry Alexie told him about a potlatch house at Qualcho Lake, west of Ulkatcho Village. Theresa Holte said her elders told her about the potlatch at Nagwuntl\u2019oo in Anahim Lake. These potlatch houses were important gathering sites for Ulkatcho people to come together to celebrate and trade.\n\nMost of the year Ulkatcho people lived in extended family groups isolated from each other as they moved about the country hunting and fishing and gathering the food and materials they needed for survival. Each family had its own fishing, hunting and trapping areas and winter quarters, usually near a lake abundant with fish. There were also a number of gathering sites throughout the territory where people came from of their remote family homes to work together to hunt, fish and preserve food for the winter. Ulkatcho families were extremely mobile and had the ability to pick up and move hundreds of kilometres across the country on very short notice when it was time to harvest the resources at a particular location. Throughout the year a family might travel from the Fraser River to the Central Coast, and from Chezlatta to the Potato Mountains in Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in territory.\n\nIn the Dakelh language, Ulkatcho means \u201cfat of the land\u201d. This name came about because Gatcho Lake and nearby lakes were full of fish and the surrounding area was rich in game and fur bearing animals. The elders say one of the important reasons people came together at Ulkatcho Village was to hunt caribou. A large group of people was needed for the success of the hunt. They worked together to build drift fences and herd the animals into a place where they could be killed and the meat cut up. The late Chief Jimmy Stillas said all the animals in a small herd would be killed and the meat shared among the whole community.\n\nTanya Lakes, known as Taintezli or Tanyez Tezdli in the Ulkatcho dialect, was another important gathering site along the Nuxalk-Dakelh Grease Trail west of Ulkatcho Village. The large camping grounds west of Tanya Lakes known as Taintezli (where the slow water of the lake becomes the fast water of the creek) was at the fork of the grease trails to Kimsquit and Bella Coola Valley. One fork followed Takia Creek to the Dean River, Salmon House Falls and Kimsquit, and the other trail went over the Rainbow Mountains to Bella Coola. Tanya Lakes and Salmon House Falls were important salmon fishing sites in Ulkatcho territory. When the spring salmon and steelhead arrived in Takia Creek to spawn at Taintezli in August, many Ulkatcho families along with their Dakelh, Nuxalk and Tsilhqot\u2019in neighbours camped there to catch and dry the fish. Several families had smokehouses at Taintesli. There were other smokehouses further down Takia Creek closer to where the big spring salmon were caught in the river, and smokehouses at Salmon House Falls on the Dean River. These gatherings like the one at Taintesli were important social times. Traditional games like lahal and other competitions like running races, horseback races, wrestling matches, spear-throwing and shooting contests were held. Lahal was a serious gambling game and Chief Jimmy Stillas said sometimes a person lost their horse in a lahal game and had to walk home.\n\nUlkatcho people have family ties with neighbouring Dakelh communities of Chezlatta, Lhoosk\u2019us Dene, Lhtalo Dene (Red Bluff) and Nazko. Also a significant number of Ulkatcho families are related to the Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in and Nuxalk as well. One of the names given to the the Ulkatchot\u2019en by their Dakelh neighbours was Nechowt\u2019en which means \u201cDakelh people mixed with Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in\u201d. O82Famous Nuxalk game guide and grizzly bear hunter Clayton Mack, whose first wife, Cecelia \u201cDoll\u201d Capoose, was an Ulkatcho woman from Abuntlet, once described Anahim Lake as the place where Indigenous people from different backgrounds \u201cmixed and lived\u201d. This diversity can be seen as one of the strengths of the Ulkatcho community.

We have traditionally shared this region with our Nlaka\u2019pamux neighbours, the Interior Salish Nation that inhabited the Thompson River region to the south. Our alliances, exchanges, and intermarriages with our neighbours over the centuries have made us a strong and diverse community. Before European colonization brought about the removal of our people from our traditional settlements, we lived in villages ranging in size from just a few families to several hundred residents. Village and band autonomy were strongly valued, and chiefs were recognized on the basis of achievement or heredity. We actively pursued peaceful means in resolving issues between groups and placed great weight on qualities of modesty and respect. We were stewards of the lands and waters that nourished us and treated them with reverence. We took only what was needed and were experts in the uses of plants and animals.

One day chipmunk was teasing sasquatch, climbing all over him up and down, and he bit him. Sasquatch went blind with rage and anger at the chipmunk for biting him, he went to catch him but ended up scratching the chipmunk along his back, making him bleed.

The Secwepemc Nation was traditionally a self-governing people who were united by Secwepemctsin language, culture and belief system; however the bands were operated separate and independent from each other.
